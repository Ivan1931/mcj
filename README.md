# What is this?
Writing javascript can be a bit tiresome at times. In this project I'm trying to find the minimum amount of code needed
to replace all javascript with a language of great academic lor - scheme. I was inspired to engage in this holy war by reading an
article by Peter Norvig who did this in python. Regression to the mean suggests that anything that was once in python will
will be completely rewritten in javascript.
